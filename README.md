# Presentation of the projet
The first objective of our work is to build the best representative subject. To achieve that, we will use tools from the optimal transport that will allow us to have a better alignment between individuals
and to generate a better quality group profile. The choice to work with the theory of optimal transport is motivated by the fact that the different connectivity maps can be seen as different
probability distributions. The goal of optimal transport is to define the least costly transformation from one distribution to another. 
This allows us to determine the group profile as the barycenter of all the individual profiles, in the sense of optimal transport, and thus to project
them onto the group profile.

Our secondary objective is to study stratification within the population to see if it exists. For this we used the kmedoids and the isomap.
